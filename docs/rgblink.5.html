<p class="Pp">The linker script is an external file that allows the user to
    specify the order of sections at link time and in a centralized manner.</p>
<p class="Pp">A linker script consists of a series of bank declarations, each
    optionally followed by a list of section names (in double quotes) or
    directives. All reserved keywords (bank types and directive names) are
    case-insensitive; all section names are case-sensitive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any line can contain a comment starting with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">;</code>&#x2019; that ends at the end of the
  line.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>; This line is a comment
ROMX $F            ; start a bank
  &quot;Some functions&quot; ; a section name
  ALIGN 8          ; a directive
  &quot;Some array&quot;

WRAMX 2            ; start another bank
  org $d123        ; another directive
  &quot;Some variables&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Numbers can be in decimal or hexadecimal format (the prefix is
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">$</code>&#x2019;). It is an error if any section
    name or directive is found before setting a bank.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files can be included by using the <code class="Ic">INCLUDE</code>
    keyword, followed by a string with the path of the file that has to be
    included.</p>
<p class="Pp">The possible bank types are: <code class="Cm">ROM0</code>,
    <code class="Cm">ROMX</code>, <code class="Cm">VRAM</code>,
    <code class="Cm">SRAM</code>, <code class="Cm">WRAM0</code>,
    <code class="Cm">WRAMX</code>, <code class="Cm">OAM</code> and
    <code class="Cm">HRAM</code>. Unless there is a single bank, which can occur
    with types <code class="Cm">ROMX</code>, <code class="Cm">VRAM</code>,
    <code class="Cm">SRAM</code> and <code class="Cm">WRAMX</code>, it is
    mandatory to specify a bank number after the type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Section names in double quotes support the same character escape
    sequences as strings in <a class="Xr" href="./rgbasm.5">rgbasm(5)</a>,
    specifically &#x2018;<code class="Li">\\</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\&quot;</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\n</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\r</code>&#x2019;, and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\t</code>&#x2019;. Other backslash escape sequences
    in <a class="Xr" href="./rgbasm.5">rgbasm(5)</a> are only relevant to
    assembly code and do not apply in section names.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a new bank statement is found, sections found after it will
    be placed right from the beginning of that bank. If the linker script
    switches to a different bank and then comes back to a previous one, it will
    continue from the last address that was used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only three directives are <code class="Ic">ORG</code>,
    <code class="Ic">ALIGN</code>, and <code class="Ic">DS</code>:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li id="ORG"><a class="permalink" href="#ORG"><code class="Ic">ORG</code></a>
      sets the address in which new sections will be placed. It can not be lower
      than the current address.</li>
  <li id="ALIGN"><a class="permalink" href="#ALIGN"><code class="Ic">ALIGN</code></a>
      will increase the address until it is aligned to the specified boundary
      (it tries to set to 0 the number of bits specified after the directive:
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">ALIGN 8</code>&#x2019; will align to $100).</li>
  <li id="DS"><a class="permalink" href="#DS"><code class="Ic">DS</code></a>
      will increase the address by the specified non-negative amount.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp" id="Note"><a class="permalink" href="#Note"><b class="Sy">Note</b></a>:
    The bank, alignment, address and type of sections can be specified both in
    the source code and in the linker script. For a section to be able to be
    placed with the linker script, the bank, address and alignment must be left
    unassigned in the source code or be compatible with what is specified in the
    linker script. For example, &#x2018;<code class="Li">ALIGN[8]</code>&#x2019;
    in the source code is compatible with &#x2018;<code class="Li">ORG
    $F00</code>&#x2019; in the linker script.</p>
